If you're encountering a Vercel deployment error stating that the git author must have access to the project, here's how to fix it step by step.

## The Problem

When deploying to Vercel, you might see an error message indicating that the git author doesn't have access to the project. This typically happens when:

- Your Vercel account is not properly connected to your GitHub account
- The GitHub account you're using doesn't have the necessary permissions for the project

## The Solution

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. Click on your user profile icon in the top right corner of the Vercel dashboard
2. Select "Account Settings" from the dropdown menu
3. Navigate to the "Authentication" section
4. Add your GitHub account as an authentication method
5. Log out of your Vercel account
6. Log back in to Vercel using your GitHub account
7. Try deploying your project again

After completing these steps, your deployment should work correctly as Vercel will now recognize your GitHub account and its associated permissions.

## Why This Works

This solution works because it ensures that:
- Your Vercel account is properly linked to your GitHub account
- The authentication flow is using the correct GitHub credentials
- Vercel can properly verify your access to the project repository

If you continue to experience issues after following these steps, make sure that:
- Your GitHub account has the necessary permissions for the repository
- You're using the correct GitHub account that has access to the project
- The repository is properly connected to your Vercel project
