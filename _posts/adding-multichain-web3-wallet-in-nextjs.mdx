This tutorial will guide you through creating a multi-chain wallet in Next.js and Supabase. 
We'll use Reown Wallet, a multi-chain wallet that supports multiple chains like Ethereum, Polygon, and BSC.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Next.js and Supabase
- Node.js and npm installed
- Reown Wallet account

## Step 1: Create a Next.js project

1. Create a new Next.js project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Name it `reown-wallet-nextjs-supabase`.

Add Yes to all the options.

2. Now we will clean up code in `./app/page.tsx` file.

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
}
```

Now let's check if the project is working.

```bash
yarn dev
```

You should see a Hello World message on the screen.

## Step 2: Install reown wallet

1. Install reown wallet in the project. First visit [Reown Wallet](https://reown.com/cloud) and create an account. Sign in and create a new project.
2. Get the project id.
3. Paste the project id in the `.env.local` file.

```bash
REOWN_PROJECT_ID=d55ea5fc0cc087e5a1f04e7a24f1156b
```

3. Install the dependencies.

```bash
yarn add @reown/appkit @reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi wagmi @tanstack/react-query
```

### Configuring Reown Wallet

In this section, we will configure the Reown Wallet for our Next.js project. This involves setting up the project ID, defining the networks we want to support, and creating a Wagmi adapter for our application.

#### Importing Necessary Modules

First, we need to import the necessary modules from the Reown Wallet and Wagmi libraries. We import `WagmiAdapter` from `@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi` to create an adapter for our Wagmi configuration. We also import various networks from `@reown/appkit/networks` that we want to support in our application. Additionally, we import `cookieStorage` and `createStorage` from `@wagmi/core` to handle storage for our Wagmi adapter.

```typescript
import { WagmiAdapter } from "@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi";
import {
  mainnet,
  arbitrum,
  base,
  optimism,
  polygon,
  AppKitNetwork,
} from "@reown/appkit/networks";
import { cookieStorage, createStorage } from "@wagmi/core";
```

#### Setting Up Project ID

Next, we define the `projectId` variable by accessing the `NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID` environment variable. If this variable is not set, we throw an error.

```typescript
export const projectId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID;

if (!projectId) {
  throw new Error("REOWN_PROJECT_ID is not set");
}
```

#### Defining Supported Networks

We then define the `networks` array, which includes the networks we imported earlier. This array is typed as an array of `AppKitNetwork` objects.

```typescript
export const networks = [mainnet, arbitrum, base, optimism, polygon] as [
  AppKitNetwork,
  ...AppKitNetwork[]
];
```

#### Creating Wagmi Adapter

Now, we create a new instance of `WagmiAdapter` and pass in the necessary configuration options. These options include the storage configuration using `cookieStorage`, setting `ssr` to `true` for server-side rendering support, the `projectId`, and the `networks` array we defined earlier.

```typescript
export const wagmiAdapter = new WagmiAdapter({
  storage: createStorage({
    storage: cookieStorage,
  }),
  ssr: true,
  projectId,
  networks,
});
```

#### Registering Adapters

We then define the `adapters` array, which contains our Wagmi adapter instance. This array is used to register adapters for our application.

```typescript
export const adapters = [wagmiAdapter];
```

#### Defining Metadata

Finally, we define the `metadata` object, which contains information about our application such as its name, description, URL, and icons.

```typescript
export const metadata = {
  name: "Demo tutorial",
  description: "AppKit Example",
  url: "https://reown.com/appkit",
  icons: ["https://assets.reown.com/reown-profile-pic.png"],
};
```

#### Exporting Wagmi Config

The `config` variable is set to the Wagmi configuration object returned by our Wagmi adapter instance. This configuration is used to initialize Wagmi in our application.

```typescript
export const config = wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig;
```

With this configuration in place, we have successfully set up the Reown Wallet for our Next.js project, enabling support for multiple blockchain networks and server-side rendering.

Now we will enable Solana support in the project.

```bash
yarn add @reown/appkit-adapter-solana @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets
```

Now we will add the Solana adapter to the project.

```typescript
import { SolanaAdapter } from "@reown/appkit-adapter-solana";
```

Now we will add the Solana adapter to the project.

```typescript
export const adapters = [wagmiAdapter, solanaAdapter];
```

Now we will add the Solana adapter to the project.

And add new networks to the project
```
import {
  ...
  solanaDevnet,
  solana,
  solanaTestnet,
} from "@reown/appkit/networks";
```

We are going to use phantom wallet for solana.

```typescript
import { phantomWallet } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets";
```

Now we will add the phantom wallet to the project.

```typescript
export const solanaAdapter = new SolanaAdapter({
  wallets: [new PhantomWalletAdapter()],
});
```

This will help us to connect to the solana network using phantom wallet.
